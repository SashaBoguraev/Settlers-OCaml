## Instructions
### General Overview:

Settlers of Catan is a game in which players attempt to develop civilizations in a new world. 
As players, you will attempt to build settlements, roads and cities in order to gain resources and pick up points.
Instructions on just how to do this are below. The game starts with a setup period, and then a period of turns, where
players will alternate performing various actions until one wins.

### Setup

Player 1 will place a settlement down first at a location of their choosing

Player 1 will then place a road off their first settlement

Player 2 will then place a settlement down at a location of their choosing

Player 2 will then place a road off their first settlement

Player 2 will then place a settlement down at a location of their choosing

Player 2 will then place a road off their second settlement

Player 1 will then place a settlement down at a location of their choosing

Player 1 will then place a road off their second settlement


### Turns 

After setup, turn play will start with player 1, alternating turns after that 

On each turn, a dice will be rolled and update player resources based on the number of settlements a player has on a tile 

Each settlement on the tile that is rolled returns 1 of that resource to a player, each city returns 2 

The player who's turn it is then has the option to build, trade, or end turn 

They can build either a settlement, road, or city if they have the allocated resources, or trade 3 of the same resource for 1 of another 

A road costs: 1 clay, 1 wood 

A settlement costs: 1 clay, 1 wood, 1 wheat, 1 sheep 

A city costs: 2 wheat, 3 ore 

### Rules 

1. No two settlements can be placed at the same location 

2. No two roads can be placed at the same location 

3. No two cities can be placed at the same location 

4. Roads can only be built off a players settlement or other road 

5. Settlements must be built off a players road 

6. Cities replace settlements, they do not build off roads 


### Winning the game 

A player has won the game when they reach 5 Victory Points 

A settlement is worth 1 Victory Point and a city is worth 2 Victory Points 

The setup settlements each count towards VP total
