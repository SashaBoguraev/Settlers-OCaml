title: Settlers of Catan Minigame
git-repo: https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/asb323/CS-3110-Project
desc: >
  Our project is a miniature version of a two player board game called
  Settlers of Catan, in which players and collect resources, build settlements, 
  and expand across the world of Catan. Our application executes in three phases- 
  a setup phase, a gameplay phase, and an ending phase triggered by a winning score 
  or a forfeit.  The application supports rule checking and automates scorekeeping 
  and resource management.
  
  We intend for our application to be used to teach beginner players the rules of
  Settlers of Catan, automate the more tedious aspects of the game for experienced
  players, and improve access and portability of the original game.
